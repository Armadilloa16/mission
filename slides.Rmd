## Work-in-Progress: Overview

Ultimately we want to arrive at Mission and Vision Statements, as well as core 
values/ attributes for our MS group here at FII. What follow are some guideline 
slides describing some of the guiding questions we will use to arrive at these, 
and places to hold the ideas we come up with during brainstorming. 

Following these slides will be three sections, titled "Mission Statement", 
"Vision Statement", and "Core Values", which will be where we store the final 
product. When we are done brainstorming and get closer to the final product we 
can reduce or even remove this slide and the following Work-in-Progress/ 
brainstorming sections.

## Work-in-Progress: Hedgehog

We will use the three questions:

1. What Drives Us?
2. Unique Strengths?
3. Current Known Economic Potential

to find the intersection between these three that will inform our brainstorming.

## Brainstorming: 1.

1. What Drives Us? (What do we want to be the best in the world at? What we 
   *cannot* be the best in the world at?)

- Being able to link/bridge different
  paradigms/languages/fields/disciplines/contexts
- We should be the best at addressing the challenges at our time for MS
- The role model/leaders/pioneers in rigorous reporting and interpretation of 
  experimental analyses/workflows/processes
- Influencing other groups to aspire to do the same
- Defining practical implementation
- A constant refinement of this principle
- Providing platform/structure/ to ensure any person coming into the lab/group 
  will be taught to get “upto-standard”
  
## Brainstorming: 1.

- Willingness to learn
- Willingness to teach
- Time management/stage-gate
- Work/life balance
- A culture that rewards challenge (e.g. recognising 
  problems/errors/improvements etc.)
- A drive to take our current weaknesses and make them our strengths

## Brainstorming: 2. Strengths

2. What are our Unique Strengths (and weaknesses)?: 

Strengths:

- Enthusiasm
- Robustness and consistency, integrity
- Australian code for responsible conduct of research
- Access to FII accelerator grants
- MS Imaging
- MALDI Biotyper
- MALDI-TOF/TOF Expertise
- Hardware access

## Brainstorming: 2. Strengths

- New group – opportunity to create a culture that aligns with our values
- Modern approach – openness

## Brainstorming: 2. Weakness

2. What are our Unique Strengths (and weaknesses)?: 

Weaknesses:

- Small group: FTE (limited in resources)
- Hardware access (2x MALDI-TOF, 1x QqQ, shared 2x Qq-TOF)
- New group – time required for lab/process setup
- Enthusiasm: capacity limitations, time management
    - Learning to say no (knowing capacity)
    - Work/life balance

## Brainstorming: 3. 

3. Current Known Economic Potential?: 


## Mission Statement

**Definition:** “A *mission statement* is a short statement of an organization's
purpose, identifying the scope of its operations: what kind of product or
service it provides, its primary customers or market, and its geographical
region of operation.”

**Our Mission Statement:**



## Vision Statement

**Definition:** “A *mission statement* is intended to clarify the 'what' and 
'who' of a company, while a *vision statement* adds the 'why' and 'how' as well. 
As a company grows, its objectives and goals may change. Therefore, 
*vision statements* should be revised as needed to reflect the changing business 
culture as goals are met.”

**Our Vision Statement:**



## Core Values

Our values should align with the University's (see following slides) as best as 
possible but cover all important aspects of our day-to-day operations:

- **Integrity:** We adhere to best practices in accordance to the 
  [Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/r39).
- **Collaboration:**
- **Social Justice:** 
- **Sustainability:**
- **Innovation:**
- **Openness:**



## UniSA Values and Attributes

What follow are several slides outlining the UniSA Core Values and Attributes,
for reference. Ultimately when we are done defining our Core Values and 
Attributes and are satisfied with how they fit with those of the university, we 
can remove this slide forward, leaving a document just describing our values, or
we could replace and/ or add a discussion of how our values/ attributes fit with 
those of the university here.
